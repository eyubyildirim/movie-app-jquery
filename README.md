## ðŸš€ Setup and Configuration

To run this project, you need a TMDb API key. The project will not work without it.

### Step 1: Get Your TMDb API Key

1.  Go to [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and create a free account.
2.  After logging in, go to your account **Settings**.
3.  In the left sidebar, click on the **API** section.
4.  Under the "Request an API Key" section, click to apply for a **Developer** key.
5.  Fill out the required information. For the application URL, you can use `http://localhost`.
6.  Once approved, you will be given an **API Read Access Token (v4 auth)**. This is the key you need. It will look something like `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...`.

### Step 2: Add the API Key to the Project

In the project files, the API key has been replaced with the placeholder text `replace-api-token`. You need to replace all instances of this placeholder with your actual key, prefixed with `Bearer `.

**The Easiest Way to Do This in VS Code:**

1.  Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2.  Open the "Search" panel on the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+F`).
3.  In the **"Search"** input field, type:
    ```
    replace-api-token
    ```
4.  In the **"Replace"** input field, type:
    ```
    Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE` with the key you got from TMDb).
5.  Click the **"Replace All"** button (the icon next to the replace field). This will update all files in the project instantly.

## How to Run

This is a pure client-side project. You can run it by simply opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

For the best experience and to avoid potential CORS issues with local file access, it is recommended to use a simple local server. If you have VS Code, the easiest way is with the **Live Server** extension.

1.  Install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) from the VS Code marketplace.
2.  Right-click on the `index.html` file in the file explorer.
3.  Select **"Open with Live Server"**.

This will open the application in your default browser, and it will automatically reload whenever you save a file.
